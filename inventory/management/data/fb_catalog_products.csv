Hyaluronic Acid is often touted for its ability to “reserve” or stop aging. In news report,
you might have heard of all of these miraculous contributions of Hyaluronic Acid to
human skin. In real fact, Hyaluronic Acid is a valuable ingredient in cosmetic; it is
marked to have an extremely high capacity to retain moisture. This is higher than any
substances known, and remains unchallenged even in low humidity. This is particularly
important since the skin tends to dry up in an atmosphere of low humidity. Due to that of
it is a large molecule, it does not penetrate deeply into the skin, instead, Hyaluronic Acid
forms a highly moisture retaining film on the skin, which is permeable to light and air. It
is invisible, not sticky and in no way obstructs the skin ability to breathe, and leaves skin
smooth and supple.
玻尿酸因其有""倒流岁月""和停止老化的功效,常被当成护肤品中不可缺少的一角。
新闻也常报导有关玻尿酸对人体皮肤的神奇""造化""。玻尿酸是有价值的化妆品成
分,有保持高度滋润能力。它的保湿度远远超越其他物质,它既有独特提升干性皮
肤的保湿能力。它既有较大的分子,故不能深入渗透肌肤,而形成一层对光和空气
有渗透性的薄膜,使皮肤有紧实效果。它是无形且不含粘性,让肌肤毫无阻碍的呼
吸,使肌肤更加光滑柔顺。玻尿酸是皮肤蛋白质的一种,是最佳保湿持有者,能够
锁住本身重量一千倍的水分。玻尿酸可保持水分,同时能维持皮肤的润滑性与柔软性。具有极强的吸水性,被喻为保湿天后,可在肌肤表面形成强力水磁场,提供肌肤全天24小时足够的保湿能力。

Hyaluronic Acid is a component of connective tissues of the body, or it can be said that it
naturally presents in our skin, but as we age, the amount of Hyaluronic Acid in the skin
starts to drop. Consequently, skin losses its elasticity and lackluster, even the formation
of wrinkles will start to aggravate. So as to counteract the effects of aging, it has become
more and more popular.
玻尿酸是一种覆盖在某些结缔组织上的物质,帮助锁主水分。但随着年龄的增长,
在人体皮肤内的玻尿酸会逐渐流失。皮肤会因此失去弹性和光泽,甚至因缺乏水分
而产生皱纹。正因如此,在对抗皮肤老化这方面,玻尿酸有绝对的""返老""能力。
It in actual fact works in hydrating and moisturizing the skin from the inside and with this
helps to smooth out wrinkles. Apart from moisturizing and hydrating plus smoothing out
wrinkles, the increase of hydration in the skin is of essential importance, as this helps
getting nutrition to the cells, as well as providing the vehicle for proper waste removal
from skin cells, it is so helps to increase the amount of water held in the extracellular
matrix of the skin.
实际上,玻尿酸能深入滋润皮肤、提供皮肤所需的水分,扶平脸上细纹。除了极佳

的皮肤,使其保持健康状态。 尿囊素具有愈合,舒缓和抗刺激作用。 它是优越的
细胞增生修复剂,可刺激健康组织的形成。
Benefits 益处:
- Moisturizes: Allantoin acts as an emollient that keeps your skin moisturized and
prevents dryness and irritation.
保湿:尿囊素可作为润肤剂,让您的皮肤保持湿润,防止干燥和刺激。
- Soothes skin: Allantoin has the additional functionality of being a calming
agent. It soothes and protects the skin by forming complexes with irritant and
sensitizing agents.
舒缓肌肤:尿囊素具有作为镇静剂的额外功能。 它通过与刺激物和致敏剂
形成复合物来舒缓和保护皮肤。

promote wound healing and is often used to treat skin irritation and rashes.
改善皮肤愈合:它有助于舒缓受伤的皮肤并促进伤口愈合,通常用于治疗
皮肤刺激和皮疹。
- Exfoliates: Allantoin is also keratolytic, which means it exfoliates dead skin cells.
It helps desquamation, the shedding of the outermost membrane or layer of tissue
from the inside out.
祛角质:尿囊素也是角质溶解剂,这意味着它可以去除死皮细胞。 它有助
于脱屑,即从内向外脱落最外层的膜或组织层。
- Hydrates: Its keratolytic property can increase the water contents of cells,
therefore, fighting against the damage of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) in the
dermis, which keeps the skin looking plump and youthful. 水合物:它的角质溶解特性可以增加细胞的水分含量,从而对抗真皮中的
经表皮失水(TEWL)的损害,使皮肤看起来丰满和年轻。

-Improves skin dullness: Allantoin promotes cell proliferation and
supports overall ""remodeling"". If the skin is stressed by the usual and customary
list of offenders, then the skin is going to try to repair itself as opposed to having
more cells turn over. What we want to do with the epidermis is to have it
constantly exfoliating itself and having more cells be produced because that’s
how you get a faster transit time of the epidermal cells. As people get older, then
that transit time from the base layer of the epidermis to the top layer takes longer
and also the skin is stressed, and those are some of the causes of dull, dry skin, too.
This is going to help with that cell proliferation.
改善皮肤暗沉:尿囊素促进细胞增殖并支持整体“重塑”。 如果皮肤受到惯
常的罪犯名单的压力,那么皮肤会尝试自我修复,而不是让更多的细胞翻
身。 我们想要对表皮做的就是让它不断地自我剥落并产生更多的细胞,因
为这就是你如何获得更快的表皮细胞通过时间的方式。 随着人们年龄的增
长,从表皮底层到顶层的运输时间需要更长的时间,皮肤也会受到压力,这
些也是导致皮肤暗沉、干燥的一些原因。 这将有助于细胞增殖。
- Smoothes skin: It removing surface dead skin cells (stratum corneum), it also
helps keep the skin smooth and soft.
抚平肌肤:祛除表面死皮细胞(角质层),还有助于保持肌肤光滑柔滑。
- Rejuvenates the cells: Although it's gentle, it can still be an effective anti-aging
ingredient. Allantoin is highly beneficial in facilitating collagen synthesis. As it
stimulates the fibroblasts (cells responsible for producing collagen), it also boosts
extracellular matrix synthesis, which is why it is strong rejuvenator.
使细胞恢复活力:虽然它很温和,但它仍然是一种有效的抗衰老成分。 尿囊素对促进胶原蛋白合成非常有益。 由于它刺激成纤维细胞(负责产生胶原蛋白的细胞),它还促进细胞外基质的合成,这就是它是强效再生剂的原因。

Betaine
What Are the Benefits of Betaine for the Skin? 甜菜碱对皮肤有什么好处?
Despite being a little-known ingredient in skincare, betaine has a variety of benefits that
it can provide to the skin. These include hydration, anti-aging, and soothing to the skin.
Betaine is naturally non-irritating and safe for most skin types.
尽管甜菜碱是护肤品中鲜为人知的成分,但它可以为皮肤提供多种益处。 这些包
括保湿、抗衰老和舒缓皮肤。 甜菜碱对大多数皮肤类型天然无刺激性和安全性。
Benefits 益处:
Hydrating 补水
Betaine helps to improve the hydration levels in the skin, giving your skin that dewy,
plumped look. Betaine does this by mediating the osmosis process. Osmosis is the
process of water balancing within the body. If one area is dehydrated, then osmosis
allows the flow of water into that area to create a balance. As an osmolyte, the
structure of betaine enables it to attract moisture and help to maintain cell water balance.
This function of betaine is particularly crucial for skin cells that are dehydrated or
exposed to UV radiation. Furthermore, the ability of betaine to increase skin hydration
has been shown to have an anti-wrinkle effect. 

甜菜碱有助于改善皮肤的水合作用水平,让您的皮肤看起来水润饱满。 甜菜碱通
过调节渗透过程来做到这一点。 渗透是体内水分平衡的过程。 如果某个区域脱
水,则渗透作用允许水流入该区域以形成平衡。 作为渗透剂,甜菜碱的结构使其
能够吸引水分并帮助维持细胞水分平衡。 甜菜碱的这一功能对于脱水或暴露于紫
外线辐射的皮肤细胞尤为重要。 此外,甜菜碱增加皮肤水合作用的能力已被证明
具有抗皱作用。
Skin hydration is a vital part of general skin health as when the skin is dehydrated; it is
more susceptible to damage, infection, and dullness.
当皮肤脱水时,皮肤水合作用是一般皮肤健康的重要组成部分; 它更容易受到损
伤、感染和暗沉。
Research has found that betaine can also improve tight junction integrity. Tight
junctions are protein complexes that prevent leakage of solutes and water between the
cells. Tight junctions have been suggested to contribute to the prevention of penetration
of harmful substances, such as allergens, pollutants, etc. into the skin. Additionally,
tight junctions aid in preventing water loss through the skin. Therefore, by improving
tight junction integrity, betaine increases the hydration status of the skin and also
protects the skin from harmful environmental substances.
研究发现甜菜碱还可以改善紧密连接的完整性。 紧密连接是防止细胞间溶质和水
泄漏的蛋白质复合物。 已建议紧密连接有助于防止有害物质(例如过敏原、污染
物等)渗入皮肤。 此外,紧密的连接有助于防止水分通过皮肤流失。 因此,通过
改善紧密连接的完整性,甜菜碱可增加皮肤的水合作用状态,同时保护皮肤免受
有害环境物质的侵害。

Anti-aging 抗衰老
A few studies have looked into the potential benefits of betaine as an anti-aging
ingredient. This suggested benefit is thought to come from its ability to protect the skin
from free radical damage. Imbalance in free radicals’ levels occur during a process
called oxidative stress and can cause damage to the cells. Oxidative stress occurs in
response to environmental stress, such as UV damage, and is considered to be part of
the aging process.
一些研究调查了甜菜碱作为抗衰老成分的潜在益处。 这种建议的好处被认为来自
其保护皮肤免受自由基损伤的能力。 自由基水平的不平衡发生在称为氧化应激的
过程中,并可能对细胞造成损害。 氧化应激是对环境压力的反应,例如紫外线损
伤,被认为是老化过程的一部分。
Anti-irritation 抗刺激
Betaine is also used as it is a non-irritating ingredient and may help soothe inflamed
sensitized skin. Betaine is less irritating than water and helps to maintain the skin’s
natural barrier, protecting the skin from water loss, allergens, and bacteria. A healthy
skin barrier is important for preventing irritation and sensitivity.
甜菜碱也被使用,因为它是一种无刺激性成分,可能有助于舒缓发炎的敏感皮
肤。 甜菜碱的刺激性比水小,有助于维持皮肤的天然屏障,保护皮肤免受水分流
失、过敏原和细菌的侵害。 健康的皮肤屏障对于防止刺激和敏感很重要。

Advanced Moisture Complex (AMC)
High Performance Moisturization 高性能的保湿
Advanced Moisture Complex (AMC) is a balanced blend of performance ingredients
(moisturizers, humectants, film formers, conditioners, and water-binding agents) each of
which address the different causes of dry skin. Each component of AMC is a
performance ingredient in its own right, yet none of the components alone provide
sustained, long-term moisturization.

创造者、调节者和水结合剂)于处理每种不同皮肤干燥的原因。AMC 的每一种成
份是有自身的性能,但没有一种成份能单独提供持续及长期的保湿。
Composition of Advanced Moisture Complex 高级保湿成份的复合物
Glycerin, the humectant component of AMC, prevents moisture loss by holding onto
some of the water associated with the skin that would normally be lost to the atmosphere
(TEWL). Glycerin can also “attract” water back into the skin from the environment.
甘油是 AMC 组织的保湿剂,以支持一些通常会失去空气( TEWL )与水有关的
皮肤防止水分流失 。甘油也可以从外“引”水回入皮肤里。

Sodium PCA penetrates skin and, like glycerin, retains moisture and slows its eventual
loss through evaporation. Sodium PCA and urea are two components that comprise the
Natural Moisturizing Factor (NMF).
Sodium PCA 渗透皮肤,如甘油,保持水分及最终延缓其通过蒸发的损失。Sodium
PCA 和尿素是由天然保湿因子( NMF )构成的两种成份 。
Urea is included in AMC as a facilitator as well as a moisturizer. In small amounts, urea
has good water-binding properties. It draws moisture in to the cells of the stratum
corneum, assisting the deeper penetration of Natural Moisturizing Factor (NMF)
molecules: the nutrients the body uses to keep hair and skin healthy and moisturized.
AMC 中包含的尿素作为调解及保湿者。在少量里,尿素具有良好的水结合性能。
它提供水分于角质层的细胞,协助渗入天然保湿因子( NMF )的分子:身体用的
养分以保持健康与湿润的头发及肌肤。
Trehalose is a naturally occurring, non-reducing disaccharide composed of two glucose
molecules. In organisms and tissues, it enables survival in conditions of extreme
dehydration. On a molecular level, Trehalose stabilizes complex membranes and proteins
as water evaporates or is removed. In skin care, Trehalose helps prevent damage from
dehydration by maintaining the liquid crystalline lamellar structure of the epidermal lipid
permeability barrier.
海藻糖是一种自然产生的,不会减少二糖组成的两个葡萄糖分子。在生物和组织
里,它能够生存于极端脱水的状况里。在分子的级别上,海藻糖稳定复合膜和蛋白

Composition of Plants Complex
Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract
Cimicifuga racemosa, Native Americans valued the herb and
used it for many conditions, ranging from gynecological
problems to rattlesnake bites. In 19th century, Some American
physicians used Cimicifuga racemosa for fever, menstrual
cramps, arthritis, and insomnia. Cimicifuga racemosa contains
several ingredients, including triterpene glycosides (e.g., acetin
and 27-deoxyactein) and isoflavones (e.g., formononetin). Other
constituents include aromatic acids, tannins, resins, fatty acids,
starches, and sugars. In the beginning menopause, the signals
between the ovaries and pituitary gland diminish, slowing down
estrogen production and increasing luteinizing hormone (LH) secretions. Hot flashes can
result from these hormonal changes. In the German clinical trials, the usefulness of
Cimicifuga racemosa for women with hot flashes associated with menopause was
demonstrated. A review of eight clinical trials found Cimicifuga racemosa to be both safe
and effective for symptomic relief of menopausal hot flashes. Other symptoms which
improved included night sweats, insomnia, nervousness, and irritability.

宁、树脂、不饱和脂肪酸、淀粉和糖。在更年期开始时,卵巢和垂体之间的信号减
少,雌激素的生产因此减缓且黄体生成素(LH)的分泌随之增加。潮热就是因这
些荷尔蒙的变化而产生的。在德国的临床试验证明了升麻李能有效地治疗与更年期
