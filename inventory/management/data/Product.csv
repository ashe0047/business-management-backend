human skin. In real fact, Hyaluronic Acid is a valuable ingredient in cosmetic; it is
marked to have an extremely high capacity to retain moisture. This is higher than any
substances known, and remains unchallenged even in low humidity. This is particularly
important since the skin tends to dry up in an atmosphere of low humidity. Due to that of
it is a large molecule, it does not penetrate deeply into the skin, instead, Hyaluronic Acid
forms a highly moisture retaining film on the skin, which is permeable to light and air. It

Hyaluronic Acid is a component of connective tissues of the body, or it can be said that it
naturally presents in our skin, but as we age, the amount of Hyaluronic Acid in the skin

-Improves skin dullness: Allantoin promotes cell proliferation and

list of offenders, then the skin is going to try to repair itself as opposed to having
more cells turn over. What we want to do with the epidermis is to have it
constantly exfoliating itself and having more cells be produced because that’s
how you get a faster transit time of the epidermal cells. As people get older, then
that transit time from the base layer of the epidermis to the top layer takes longer
and also the skin is stressed, and those are some of the causes of dull, dry skin, too.
This is going to help with that cell proliferation.

Betaine
What Are the Benefits of Betaine for the Skin? ????????????
Despite being a little-known ingredient in skincare, betaine has a variety of benefits that
it can provide to the skin. These include hydration, anti-aging, and soothing to the skin.
Betaine is naturally non-irritating and safe for most skin types.
?????????????????,?????????????? ???
????????????? ??????????????????????
Benefits ??:
Hydrating ??
Betaine helps to improve the hydration levels in the skin, giving your skin that dewy,
plumped look. Betaine does this by mediating the osmosis process. Osmosis is the
process of water balancing within the body. If one area is dehydrated, then osmosis
allows the flow of water into that area to create a balance. As an osmolyte, the
structure of betaine enables it to attract moisture and help to maintain cell water balance.
This function of betaine is particularly crucial for skin cells that are dehydrated or
exposed to UV radiation. Furthermore, the ability of betaine to increase skin hydration
has been shown to have an anti-wrinkle effect. 

?????????????????,????????????? ????
?????????????? ????????????? ???????
?,??????????????????? ?????,????????
?????????????????? ?????????????????
?????????????? ??,??????????????????
???????
Skin hydration is a vital part of general skin health as when the skin is dehydrated; it is
more susceptible to damage, infection, and dullness.
??????,????????????????????; ???????
????????
Research has found that betaine can also improve tight junction integrity. Tight
junctions are protein complexes that prevent leakage of solutes and water between the
cells. Tight junctions have been suggested to contribute to the prevention of penetration
of harmful substances, such as allergens, pollutants, etc. into the skin. Additionally,
tight junctions aid in preventing water loss through the skin. Therefore, by improving
tight junction integrity, betaine increases the hydration status of the skin and also
protects the skin from harmful environmental substances.
????????????????????? ??????????????
?????????? ????????????????(????????
??)????? ??,??????????????????? ??,??
??????????,???????????????,????????
??????????

Anti-aging ???
A few studies have looked into the potential benefits of betaine as an anti-aging
ingredient. This suggested benefit is thought to come from its ability to protect the skin
from free radical damage. Imbalance in free radicals’ levels occur during a process
called oxidative stress and can cause damage to the cells. Oxidative stress occurs in
response to environmental stress, such as UV damage, and is considered to be part of
the aging process.
??????????????????????? ????????????
???????????????? ???????????????????
???,??????????? ?????????????,??????
?,?????????????
Anti-irritation ???
Betaine is also used as it is a non-irritating ingredient and may help soothe inflamed
sensitized skin. Betaine is less irritating than water and helps to maintain the skin’s
natural barrier, protecting the skin from water loss, allergens, and bacteria. A healthy
skin barrier is important for preventing irritation and sensitivity.

Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract
Cimicifuga racemosa, Native Americans valued the herb and
used it for many conditions, ranging from gynecological
problems to rattlesnake bites. In 19th century, Some American
physicians used Cimicifuga racemosa for fever, menstrual
cramps, arthritis, and insomnia. Cimicifuga racemosa contains
several ingredients, including triterpene glycosides (e.g., acetin
and 27-deoxyactein) and isoflavones (e.g., formononetin). Other
constituents include aromatic acids, tannins, resins, fatty acids,
starches, and sugars. In the beginning menopause, the signals
between the ovaries and pituitary gland diminish, slowing down
estrogen production and increasing luteinizing hormone (LH) secretions. Hot flashes can
result from these hormonal changes. In the German clinical trials, the usefulness of
Cimicifuga racemosa for women with hot flashes associated with menopause was
demonstrated. A review of eight clinical trials found Cimicifuga racemosa to be both safe
and effective for symptomic relief of menopausal hot flashes. Other symptoms which
improved included night sweats, insomnia, nervousness, and irritability.
