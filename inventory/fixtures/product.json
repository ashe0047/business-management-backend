As people get older, then\nthat transit time from the base layer of the epidermis to the top layer takes longer\nand also the skin is stressed, and those are some of the causes of dull, dry skin, too.\nThis is going to help with that cell proliferation.\n??????:??????????????\u201c??\u201d? ???????\n?????????,???????????,??????????\n?? ????????????????????????????,?\n???????????????????????? ????????\n?,????????????????????,????????,?\n?????????????????? ??????????\n- Smoothes skin: It removing surface dead skin cells (stratum corneum), it also\nhelps keep the skin smooth and soft.\n????:????????(???),?????????????\n- Rejuvenates the cells: Although it's gentle, it can still be an effective anti-aging\ningredient. Allantoin is highly beneficial in facilitating collagen synthesis. As it\nstimulates the fibroblasts (cells responsible for producing collagen), it also boosts\nextracellular matrix synthesis, which is why it is strong rejuvenator.\n???????:??????,???????????????? ????????????????? ??????????(???????????),????????????,??????????????\n\nBetaine\nWhat Are the Benefits of Betaine for the Skin? ????????????\nDespite being a little-known ingredient in skincare, betaine has a variety of benefits that\nit can provide to the skin. These include hydration, anti-aging, and soothing to the skin.\nBetaine is naturally non-irritating and safe for most skin types.\n?????????????????,?????????????? ???\n????????????? ??????????????????????\nBenefits ??:\nHydrating ??\nBetaine helps to improve the hydration levels in the skin, giving your skin that dewy,\nplumped look. Betaine does this by mediating the osmosis process. Osmosis is the\nprocess of water balancing within the body. If one area is dehydrated, then osmosis\nallows the flow of water into that area to create a balance. As an osmolyte, the\nstructure of betaine enables it to attract moisture and help to maintain cell water balance.\nThis function of betaine is particularly crucial for skin cells that are dehydrated or\nexposed to UV radiation. Furthermore, the ability of betaine to increase skin hydration\nhas been shown to have an anti-wrinkle effect. \n\n?????????????????,????????????? ????\n?????????????? ????????????? ???????\n?,??????????????????? ?????,????????\n?????????????????? ?????????????????\n?????????????? ??,??????????????????\n???????\nSkin hydration is a vital part of general skin health as when the skin is dehydrated; it is\nmore susceptible to damage, infection, and dullness.\n??????,????????????????????; ???????\n????????\nResearch has found that betaine can also improve tight junction integrity. Tight\njunctions are protein complexes that prevent leakage of solutes and water between the\ncells. Tight junctions have been suggested to contribute to the prevention of penetration\nof harmful substances, such as allergens, pollutants, etc. into the skin. Additionally,\ntight junctions aid in preventing water loss through the skin. Therefore, by improving\ntight junction integrity, betaine increases the hydration status of the skin and also\nprotects the skin from harmful environmental substances.\n????????????????????? ??????????????\n?????????? ????????????????(????????\n??)????? ??,??????????????????? ??,??\n??????????,???????????????,????????\n??????????\n\nAnti-aging ???\nA few studies have looked into the potential benefits of betaine as an anti-aging\ningredient. This suggested benefit is thought to come from its ability to protect the skin\nfrom free radical damage. Imbalance in free radicals\u2019 levels occur during a process\ncalled oxidative stress and can cause damage to the cells. Oxidative stress occurs in\nresponse to environmental stress, such as UV damage, and is considered to be part of\nthe aging process.\n??????????????????????? ????????????\n???????????????? ???????????????????\n???,??????????? ?????????????,??????\n?,?????????????\nAnti-irritation ???\nBetaine is also used as it is a non-irritating ingredient and may help soothe inflamed\nsensitized skin. Betaine is less irritating than water and helps to maintain the skin\u2019s\nnatural barrier, protecting the skin from water loss, allergens, and bacteria. A healthy\nskin barrier is important for preventing irritation and sensitivity.\n???????,????????????,?????????????\n?? ??????????,????????????,?????????\n???????????? ????????????????????\nTexture ??\nBetaine also functions as a texture enhancer in cosmetics and skincare products.",
